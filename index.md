Welcome to the course website for OMDA 11:628:364, as taught in Spring 2024 by Professor David Bushek and Professor Travis Miles. The goal of this course is to **equip undergraduate students to analyze oceanographic data with confidence using the Python programming language and to teach them to collect oceanographic data using observational methods by letting them go on the site**.


On this website, you can find:

- the course [syllabus](about.md),
- information about the [co-instructors](staff.md),
- and a weekly [calendar](calendar.md) with links to videos, slides, activities, assignments, and other resources.

### Evaluation study

*We conducted a retrospective study assessing the efficacy of the course elements and teaching strategies that we used in Autumn 2020. The manuscript has been submitted to Journal of Geoscience Education and is available as [a preprint on the Earth and Space Science Open Archive (ESSOAr)](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168839439.99576639/v1).
